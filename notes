H = Hamiltonian
Ra, ri = position vectors

r = electron positions, i,j,k
R = nucli positions, A,B,C

r_iA = |r_i - R_A|

H  = M_A = ratio of nueculs mass to electron mass
Z_a = atomic number of nucleus A

orbital = wave function for single particle
molecular orbital = wave func of elec in molecule
spatial orbital = function of position vector r, describes probabillity of finding electron in a certain region
